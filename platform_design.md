# Federated Learning Platform Architecture Design

## Project Overview
A privacy-preserving federated learning platform for drug trials that enables hospitals to share treatment efficacy data while maintaining patient privacy and HIPAA compliance.

## Key Features
1. **Hospital Registration & Authentication**
   - Secure hospital account creation
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management

2. **Drug Trials Management**
   - Create and manage drug trials
   - Upload patient medical reports
   - Track treatment success rates
   - Federated learning integration

3. **Patient Management**
   - Patient data within hospital boundaries
   - Privacy-preserving data sharing
   - Eligibility matching for drug trials

4. **Federated Learning Network**
   - Cross-hospital data aggregation
   - Privacy-preserving algorithms
   - Real-time network metrics
   - Treatment insights dashboard

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React)
- Modern responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Component-based architecture using shadcn/ui
- Real-time dashboard with charts (Recharts)
- File upload for medical reports
- Interactive data visualization

### Backend (Flask)
- RESTful API endpoints
- JWT authentication
- Database models for hospitals, patients, trials
- Federated learning engine integration
- HIPAA-compliant data handling

### Database Schema
```
Hospitals: id, name, address, contact_info, registration_date
Users: id, hospital_id, username, password_hash, role
Patients: id, hospital_id, patient_id, demographics (anonymized)
DrugTrials: id, hospital_id, drug_name, indication, phase, success_rate
MedicalReports: id, patient_id, trial_id, report_file, upload_date
FederatedModels: id, drug_name, aggregated_data, model_weights
```

### Privacy & Security
- End-to-end encryption for data transmission
- Local data processing with federated aggregation
- Differential privacy mechanisms
- Role-based access control
- HIPAA compliance measures

## User Workflows

### Hospital Registration
1. Hospital admin creates account
2. Verification and approval process
3. Access to platform dashboard

### Drug Trial Submission
1. Hospital uploads patient medical report
2. System extracts relevant data (anonymized)
3. Local model training on patient data
4. Federated aggregation with other hospitals
5. Shared insights available to network

### Cross-Hospital Insights
1. Hospitals view aggregated drug efficacy data
2. Patient eligibility matching for trials
3. Treatment recommendations based on federated learning
4. Privacy-preserved collaboration

## UI/UX Design Principles
- Clean, professional medical interface
- Intuitive navigation and workflows
- Real-time data visualization
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility compliance
- Trust-building design elements for healthcare
